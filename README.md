### ERRATA
- Page 6. In the second paragraph, the vertical bars for the intervals are cut off. They should be square brackets that look like [−1,1] and [0,1].
- Page 50. On the first line following Equation (3.61), the upper limit of the summation should be n, not k.
- Page 160. On line 2, the reference to Section 10.4.7 should be to Section 10.3.7.
- Page 239. In Equation (8.58), the value of B should be normalized by dividing it by ‖N1 × N2‖.
- Page 241. The first displayed equation on the page, giving the effective radius of a box with respect to a plane, should match Equation (8.47) and read reff = ½(|R · N| + |S · N| + |T · N|).
- Page 321. In Figure 11.1, the bottom-most curve should be labeled t2(t − 1).
- Page 338. The first line of Equation (11.73) should read Q1(t) = B0(t)P0 + B1(t)P1 + B2(t)P2 + B3(t)P3
